## 🎯 PROJECT GOAL (READ CAREFULLY)

This project is a **static marketing landing page** for an ERC-20 token.

**Purpose:**

* Public visibility
* Etherscan token information approval
* Branding credibility

**This is NOT a dApp.**

---

## 🧱 ALLOWED TECH STACK (LOCKED)

Copilot may use **ONLY**:

* Next.js (App Router)
* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* Static assets from `/public`

NO OTHER DEPENDENCIES.

---

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE (DO NOT MODIFY)

Copilot must assume this structure and never alter it:

```
src/
└─ app/
   ├─ layout.tsx
   ├─ page.tsx
   └─ globals.css
public/
└─ (logos + images only)
```

---

## 📄 `layout.tsx` RULES

Copilot must:

* Use semantic HTML
* Include SEO-friendly metadata

```

**Description format:**

```

---

## 🛑 FINAL COMMAND TO COPILOT

When starting work, Copilot must assume:
